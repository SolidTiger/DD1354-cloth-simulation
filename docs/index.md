## Cloth Simulation project

### What is this?
This is a project in the course DD1354 Models and Simulations at KTH in sweden. The purpose is to implement a real time cloth simulation. Here is a link to our [project spec](https://solidtiger.github.io/DD1354-cloth-simulation/ProjSpec).

### Project
In our project we work with stretch goals you can see the status here.

| Goal          | Priority      | Status|
| -------------|:-------------:| -----:|
| Mass spring system              | High               | Done       |
| RK4              | High              | Done      | 
| Nice color/Texture              | Low              | Done       |
| Make a unity project | High | Done |
| Research cloth mass spring systems | High | Partially |
| Real time simulation | Low | Partially |
| Sphere collision | Low | Done |
| Collide with a approximate human model | Low | Not Done |
| Make mesh look like clothing | Low | Not done |
